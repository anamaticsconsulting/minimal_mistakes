<b>Project Name:</b>
Finance Data Monitoring
<br>
<br>
<b>Industry:</b>
Business-to-Business Distribution
<br>
<br>
<b>Business Problem:</b>
As the complexity of their Order to Cash (OTC) infrastructure increased the Finance Organization was struggling to stabilize their infrastructure, gain visibility into the technical issues, and understand the breakdowns and financial impacts associated with transactions traversing a complex flow through their own and a 3rd party vendor’s infrastructure.
<br>
<br>
<b>How Anamatics Helped:</b>
Anamatics assessed the problem and conceptualized a solution to provide increased visibility into transactional data processing.  This enabled Finance and IT to proactively identify and rectify issues before they impacted key financial processes such as month-end close.  Anamatics architected and developed a solution to take snapshots of transactional data as it flowed through our client’s infrastructure. Snapshots were catalogued and stored in a data warehouse where they could be connected to Power BI.  Power BI was leveraged to provide visibility to the processing status of all transactions in the OTC infrastructure.  Providing this level of granular visibility and tracking enabled the business and IT to partner to better root cause issues in the infrastructure and prioritize corresponding resolutions.  It also simplified the business’ ability to proactively detect key variances between management reporting systems and their general ledger and to appropriately action them in accordance with corresponding service level agreements.
