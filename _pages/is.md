Project Name: 
<b><u>Investment Scorecard</u></b>
<b>Industry:</b>
Business-to-Business Distribution 
<b>Business Problem:</b>
A B2B distribution client was struggling to understand the holistic ROI of their partners’ multi-tiered investments. Data was scattered throughout multiple disparate systems and business logic to calculate ROI was nebulous. Our client engaged Anamatics to help architect a solution, define ROI metrics, and deliver reporting and analytics solutions. This provided them with the ability to demonstrate and optimize the effectiveness of their partners’ investments. 
<b>How Anamatics Helped:</b>
This project began as an ambiguous concept with challenges spanning from disparate data to ambiguous requirements. Anamatics developed a working prototype which enabled the project team to collaborate with the business, to iterate through requirements, and to define the associated business benefits of the project.  
As the project team clarified requirements for the final dashboards, Anamatics’ data resources collaborated (including data pipeline/ETL code review and transition) with our client’s IT Team to move data from disparate systems into a centralized, tabular data mart. This enabled Anamatics to operationalize the creation of Partner Investment Dashboards using Power BI.  The solution provided a new level of insight into Partner’s comprehensive investments while giving our client visibility into key partner KPIs including PO Aging, Marketing ROI, and Promotion Effectiveness.
