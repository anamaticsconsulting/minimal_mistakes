<b>Project Name:</b>
Marketing Analytics
<br>
<br>
<b>Industry:</b>
Life Sciences
<br>
<br>
<b>Business Problem:</b>
The Specialty Business Unit of a Large Life Sciences client was struggling to in-house a data capability to gauge the effectiveness of their multi-channel digital marketing campaigns. With multiple partners (ex. platforms, data providers, and agencies) and multiple marketing campaigns executing simultaneously, the client found itself lacking a strategy and the appropriate infrastructure, governance, and processes to land, interpret, and leverage their digital marketing data.

<br>
<b>How Anamatics Helped:</b>
Anamatics was brought in to take the lead on providing end-to-end support related to streamlining optimization and centralization of marketing data and provided added support in the interpretation and analysis of their data.  Anamatics setup cadences with the brand teams, technical teams, and project sponsors to ensure adequate progress and on-going prioritization.  Anamatics also provided both guidance and technical implementation support for onboarding data (including 3rd party providers), ETL to end-state reporting and analytics datasets, establishing data quality checks, defining effectiveness measurement KPIs, and data visualization for recurring and ad-hoc analyses. Anamatics was able to help the client develop a consistent, repeatable framework through which additional brands could be easily onboarded and consistently analyzed, and that has allowed the organization to begin focusing on optimization of efforts and spend allocation.
